⭐ Target Div2(B or C) : 
	if in a string we can think do rearrangement , finding the freq. or sorting the 
	string mostly works..

	if in an array if some opration is given such that for opr. on a[i] opr. on all
	a[j] : j < i have to be done......answerr lies in brute forcing operation
	or each a[i] for all i: [0 ,n - 1]. 

⭐ In problems related to sorting of vectors 
	=> Keeping track of the inversion indexes helps... 

⭐ General : 
	1️⃣ if solution is made but giving WA in higher order tc(s)
		try debug()
		try finding edgecases
		See others solution

⭐ To solve problem of type which says whether we can do something or not .....
	Make some assumptions and try proving whether we can achieve the goal or 	not....    like mathematical proofs -> PMI	

⭐ Constructive_Problems : 
	Mostly try drawing the testcases and find the patterns

⭐ Operations type Questions :
	Operations waale qn mei kuch obsv similar taarike se mil jaati hai
	Jaise sirf ek operation karne se solve ho sakta hai kya...
	Ya agar dono operations karenge to konse order mei karna chahiye...

⭐ In Formula based questions : 
	Always try formula for smaller i/p(s) before submitting.

⭐ In Array partition problems:
        Pattern:     
	Waise to observation hi hai, lekin ek chhota sa pattern 
	hota hai kuch qns mei ki intervals ki size 1,2 ya maybe 3 tak limit krne 	se solve ho jayega
	
	Approach:    
	Try thinking of how the solution will look like...
	and make observations out of the expected solution.. -> Greedy
