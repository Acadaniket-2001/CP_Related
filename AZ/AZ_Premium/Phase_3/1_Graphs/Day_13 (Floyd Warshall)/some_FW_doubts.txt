Can Floyd warshall detect +ve cycle ??
-> No, see line 22 comment
----------------------------------------
if(dist[i][i] < 1e9)
	yes;
else
	no;
----------------------------------------
I think it is correct ....
but

for below Eg: 
5 5
0 1 -1
1 2 -1
2 3 -1
3 4 -1
0 4 -1    // ⚠️

o/p:
Cheapest Cycle: 999999996  <  1e9          // ⭐ we can't infer that we have positive cycle of cost (999999996)
-ve Cycle not Present
i : 0, dist[i][i] : 999999996
i : 1, dist[i][i] : 999999996
i : 2, dist[i][i] : 999999996
i : 3, dist[i][i] : 999999996
i : 4, dist[i][i] : 999999996


Even if no +ve cycle is present, I am getting cheapest cycle < 1e9.
why it is so ???  --> 

ans: (999999996 < 1e9) this is because, the altough the algo. tried to relax the edges but still couldn't find -ve cycle

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doubt 2: 
	Did not clearly get, how to build the path in Floyd Warshall's algo. ??
		par[i][j] = par[k][j] ???? part....

    ans : See notes.. diagram

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doubt 3: 
	Why i am getting TLE in budget travelling while implementing my way...(mobile pic.. for approach) ???
	i tried to implement using formulation framework... 

	but if modelled it the way it was taught, i wasn't getting TLE.... why ??
	
	how to find the correct modelling ideas, non_TLE one 😁???

    ans: Practice !!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doubt 4:
	does (dis[v] == INF) check works in BFS_01() ??? ---> if not y?

    ans: it only works in BFS() due to uni-weight nature of G(V, E)
            whrereas, in BFS01()  -> wt = {0, 1};
            and,      in Dijkstra()  -> wt = [0, INF];
